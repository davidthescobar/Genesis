# How to organize code:
# 1 Write in a file
# 2 Write functions
# 3 Write classes
# 4 Write as funcitonal programming
# 5 Use modules! (Multipe files)
# Use packages! (Multiple folders)

# When naming modules, name like variables (use '_' if there are spaces!
# Each file is a 'module'
# Dedicate new files towards relevant hierarchies.abs
# A common module is 'utility' 


# a pychache file is created everytime code is compiled. It is a compiled file. Doesn't need to be touched.

# Packages are folders
# When create python packages (folders) start with a __init__.py file. This help python recognize the folder as a package.
